# formValidation

1. HTML Structure:
   - The code begins with the declaration of an HTML5 document using `<!DOCTYPE html>`.
   - It includes an HTML `<head>` section with a title for the web page.
   - Inside the `<head>`, there's a `<script>` block that contains JavaScript code for form validation.
   - The main content is in the `<body>` section.

2. JavaScript Function `validateform()`:
   - A JavaScript function named `validateform()` is defined within the `<script>` block.
   - This function is designed to validate the form before submission.
   - It begins by fetching the values entered by the user in the "name" and "password" fields using `document.myform.name.value` and `document.myform.password.value`, respectively.

3. Name Validation:
   - It checks if the "name" field is either null or an empty string.
   - If the name is blank, it displays an alert with the message "Name can't be blank" and returns `false`.
   - This prevents the form from being submitted if the name field is empty.

4. Password Validation:
   - It checks if the "password" field contains less than 6 characters.
   - If the password is less than 6 characters, it displays an alert with the message "Password must be at least 6 characters long" and returns `false`.
   - This prevents the form from being submitted if the password is too short.

5. HTML Form:
   - The HTML form is defined using the `<form>` element.
   - It has a `name` attribute set to "myform," which allows JavaScript to reference the form.
   - The form uses the HTTP POST method and specifies the action URL as "abc.jsp" for form submission.

6. Form Fields:
   - Inside the form, there are two input fields:
     - "Name" input field, which is a text input with the `name` attribute set to "name."
     - "Password" input field, which is a password input with the `name` attribute set to "password."

7. Submit Button:
   - A submit button is included within the form.
   - The `onsubmit` attribute of the form is set to `return validateform()`.
   - This means that when the user submits the form, the `validateform()` function is called first to validate the form's input fields.

8. Overall Functionality:
   - When the user submits the form:
     - The JavaScript function `validateform()` is invoked.
     - It checks the "name" and "password" fields for validation.
     - If any validation condition fails, an alert message is displayed, and the form submission is prevented.
     - If both fields pass validation, the form submission proceeds to the URL specified in the form's `action` attribute.

This code demonstrates how to add basic client-side validation to an HTML form to ensure that user input meets certain criteria before submitting the form data to the server.
